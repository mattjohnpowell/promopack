# PromoPack Pricing & SEO Strategy
**Created:** January 2025  
**Goal:** Drive monthly recurring revenue through strategic pricing and SEO targeting

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Reality Check:**
- Your `generatePack()` function creates a basic text-based PDF report, NOT a full PMCPA-ready pack with merged reference PDFs
- This limits your pricing power until the PDF generation delivers the full "15 hours → 2 hours" value proposition
- However, the **core workflow** (claim extraction, linking, compliance checking) is solid and genuinely saves time

**Recommended Pricing Strategy:**

| Tier | Price | Target Buyer | Monthly Revenue Potential |
|------|-------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Starter** | £99/mo | Junior Brand Managers (1-3 packs/month) | £99 × 20 customers = £1,980 |
| **Professional** | £179/mo | Medical Affairs Associates (5-10 packs/month) | £179 × 50 customers = £8,950 |
| **Business** | £399/mo | Medical Affairs Teams (unlimited packs, 5 users) | £399 × 10 teams = £3,990 |

**Total Monthly Revenue Target:** £14,920 (~$18,000 USD) from 80 paying customers

---

## Part 1: Pricing Analysis & Rationale

### What You Can Legitimately Charge For TODAY:

✅ **Automated Claim Extraction** (saves 3-4 hours)
- AI-powered PDF parsing
- 95% accuracy with human review
- Eliminates manual copy-paste from source documents

✅ **Claim-to-Reference Linking Workflow** (saves 4-5 hours)
- Drag-and-drop interface
- PubMed auto-search
- Structured data management

✅ **Compliance Validation** (saves 2-3 hours)
- Regex-based pattern matching
- PMCPA requirement enforcement (all claims must be linked)
- Error prevention before submission

✅ **PDF Report Generation** (saves 1-2 hours)
- Basic pack outline with claims + links
- Metadata tracking
- Structured output

**Total Time Saved:** 10-14 hours per pack (realistic, defensible)

### What You CANNOT Charge Premium Pricing For (Yet):

❌ **Full PMCPA-ready pack generation**
- Your current `generatePack()` creates a text report, not a merged PDF with bookmarks/TOC
- Missing: Merged reference PDFs, proper formatting, submission-ready output
- This is the £400-600 value prop you're advertising but not delivering

❌ **Team collaboration features**
- No commenting, version history, approval workflows yet
- Can't justify Business tier pricing without this

❌ **Advanced analytics**
- No usage dashboards, ROI tracking, or reporting

1. Deliver TRUE PMCPA-ready packs (merged PDFs, bookmarks, formatting)
2. Add team collaboration features
3. Build manager dashboards and analytics

**Your pricing is defensible if:**
- You're honest about what the tool does (saves 10-14 hours, not 15)
- You provide a genuine free trial (let them build a real pack)
- You focus on the ROI math (£99 saves £360+)

**Focus on Product-Market Fit first:**
- Get 10-20 paying customers using the Starter/Professional tiers
- Gather feedback on what features they ACTUALLY need
- Build those features before expanding to higher tiers

**Your biggest competitive advantage:**
> You're solving a painful, specific problem (PMCPA reference packs) for a niche market (UK pharma medical affairs). 
> There is NO other tool doing this. Own this niche.

Good luck! 🚀
