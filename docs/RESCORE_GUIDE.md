# How to Apply the New Relevance Scoring Rules

## ‚úÖ What's Been Updated

The new relevance scoring algorithm has been implemented and is ready to use!

### Changes Made:
1. **Improved keyword extraction** - Now preserves drug names, medical terms, and product context
2. **Better scoring algorithm** - Prioritizes drug names, fetches abstracts, and uses smarter weighting
3. **Product context integration** - Extracts product name from source document (e.g., "XARELTO" from "XARELTO-pi.pdf")
4. **Re-scoring functionality** - Can update existing suggestions with new algorithm

## üîÑ How to Apply New Rules to Existing Projects

### Option 1: Re-score Existing Suggestions (Recommended)
For projects that already have auto-found references (like your Xylo project):

1. **Open your project** (e.g., the Xylo project)
2. **Scroll to "Suggested References from PubMed"** section
3. **Click the "Re-score with New Algorithm" button** in the top-right
4. **Wait for completion** (~5-10 seconds for 15 references)
5. **Review the updated relevance scores** - they should be much more accurate now!

### Option 2: Delete and Re-run Auto-Find
If you prefer to start fresh:

1. **Reject all current suggestions** (click ‚úó Reject on each one)
2. **Go to "Extract Claims" tab**
3. **Click "Auto-Find References"** button
4. **New suggestions will use the improved algorithm** automatically

## üìä What You Should See

### Before (Old Algorithm):
- Most scores: 10-40% (Low relevance)
- Many irrelevant papers (generic hemodialysis, unrelated drugs)
- Missing abstracts
- No product-specific matching

### After (New Algorithm):
- XARELTO-specific papers: 60-90% (High/Medium relevance)
- Better filtered results (more relevant to actual claims)
- Abstracts fetched and used for scoring
- Product name (XARELTO) matched in titles and abstracts

## üéØ Example Improvements

| Claim Fragment | Old Score | New Score | Reason |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| "increase in AUCinf and a 56%" | 20% | 65% | Now extracts "XARELTO" from source doc name |
| "patients randomized to XARELTO experienced" | 50% | 80% | Better drug name matching |
| "subjects maintained with chronic and stable hemodialysis" | 60% | 35% | Correctly identifies as less relevant |

## üöÄ Quick Start

**For your Xylo project right now:**

```
1. Navigate to: Projects ‚Üí Xylo
2. Find: "Suggested References from PubMed" (blue section)
3. Click: "Re-score with New Algorithm" button
4. Wait: ~5 seconds for 15 references to be re-scored
5. Review: Updated relevance scores (should be much better!)
```

The re-scoring is **non-destructive** - it only updates the confidence scores and fetches missing abstracts. You won't lose any data.

## üí° Tips

- **Product context matters**: Make sure your source document has the product name in the filename (e.g., "XARELTO-pi.pdf", not "document1.pdf")
- **Full claims are better**: The more complete the claim text, the better the matching
- **Abstracts improve scoring**: References with abstracts will score more accurately
- **Re-scoring is safe**: You can re-run it multiple times without issues

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate Limiting

The re-scoring process includes a 300ms delay between each reference to respect PubMed's API rate limits. For 15 references, expect ~5-10 seconds total.
