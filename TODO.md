# Repo TODO

This file exports the checked ticklist from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and provides a small, maintainable list of work items and the project's testing philosophy.

## Testing philosophy (short)
We prefer a feature-first testing approach: build a feature, manually verify it, then add focused automated tests (unit/integration) for that feature. Avoid running full monorepo test suites for every small change. Use CI to run the full test suite before merging.

## Payments (new)

We need a payments system that supports both enterprise (pharma companies) and individual users (consultants, contractors, and employees of pharma companies who may pay out-of-pocket). Consider these flows and integration points:

- Enterprise (preferred by pharma):
	- Invoicing + Purchase Order (PO) support: allow enterprise accounts to pay via invoice/PO with net terms. Provide fields for company billing contact, VAT/Tax IDs, and billing addresses.
	- SSO / enterprise onboarding: sales teams create enterprise accounts and associate users, with seat-based or feature-based billing.
	- Offline payment reconciliation: support manual marking of invoices paid and webhook-driven accounting sync.
	- Integration with payment processors that support ACH/bank transfers and card-on-file (Stripe, Adyen or Braintree + invoicing tools). Consider a B2B billing flow (Stripe Billing with Invoicing or a dedicated invoicing provider) and an exportable CSV for finance.

- Individual payers (preferred by users):
	- Card payments via Stripe (checkout or Stripe Elements) for monthly/annual subscriptions or one-off purchases.
	- OAuth + quick pay flows for in-app purchases (Stripe Checkout with client-side integration).
	- Email receipts and self-service billing portal to update cards, view invoices, cancel subscriptions.

- Compliance & procurement considerations:
	- Provide invoice PDFs and clear tax fields. Support different billing addresses per project if needed.
	- Add role-based access so only billing admins can view/change billing details.

Next implementation tasks (TODOs):
- [ ] Design billing data model (accounts, subscriptions, seats, invoices, payments) in Prisma schema and migration.
- [ ] Integrate Stripe (or chosen provider) for enterprise & consumer flows; add webhooks for invoice/payment events.
- [ ] Build Billing UI (billing settings, payment method editor, invoices list, billing contacts).
- [ ] Implement server actions for creating subscriptions, submitting invoices, applying credits, and reconciling payments.
- [ ] Add exportable invoice reports for finance (CSV, PDF) and a way to mark manual payments.
